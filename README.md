# Personal Website

## Foreword
I've always has a personal website, but it's admittedly been nothing more than a generic project index. The only merit it had was that I didn't use a template. It was built in AngularJS, which has since gone through dozens of updates, making my website now officially ***old and lame!***.

The goal for Personal Website 2.0 is to create a novel personal website that I can use as a canvas (no pun intended) for experimental web dev and cool browser-based hacky stuff.

## Goals

- View built entirely using Canvas API, as inspired by Google's eventual shift to a [Canvas-based Google Docs](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html)
- Minimal libraries
- Fun experiments
- Cool animations, VFX, and user interaction
